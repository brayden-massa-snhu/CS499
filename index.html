        <p class="main-text">
          Throughout my journey in the Computer Science program, I have
          developed a diverse skill set that spans software engineering, data
          structures, algorithms, database management, full stack development,
          cyber security, and UI/UX design. I have also studied common project
          organization techniques such as Waterfall and Agile.
        </p>
        <p class="main-text">
          More importantly than the Computer Science skills I have learned, this
          program has taught me how to understand and learn new topics easily.
          The further along I got through the program, the faster I was able to
          understand new concepts, frameworks, and even programming languages.
          My ability to learn how to solve different problems has flourished
          with my time in the Computer Science program. This can be seen as
          marginally more significant than the specific skills I have learned,
          as the ability to learn new things efficiently is one of the most
          important skills I could possess in the workforce.
        </p>
        <p class="main-text">
          To support my understanding of these concepts, I have enhanced a
          project that I built for food service workers to track their tips. I
          call the application "Wage Tracker," made with React and TypeScript. I
          first developed the application in my second year in college, when I
          was still fairly new to software development. I chose to select this
          application for all three enhancements because it was in the perfect
          place of development to implement all three categories, and it is an
          app I use in my personal life, so enhancing its functionality benefits
          me in the long run. The original code contained little to no comments,
          a lack of data persistence (no database), and a lack of any useful
          data structures and algorithms. These enhancements not only highlight
          my experience in the skills listed above, but also showcase my ability
          to communicate with both technical and non-technical audiences.

        <p class="main-text">
          To showcase my skills with Software Engineering, I have decided to
          clone my Wage Tracker app into a desktop application using C# and WPF.
          This enhancement demonstrates my ability to reverse engineer a
          product, and highlights my skills to create clean and effective
          software regardless of the programming language.

              I designed and evaluated computing solutions that solve a given
              problem using algorithmic principles and computer science
              practices and standards appropriate to its solution, while
              managing the trade-offs involved in design choices.

            <p>
              Reverse engineering an application to create it in a new language
              required the ability to evaluate the current project and break it
              down into its core components. This was then used as a blueprint
              for developing the product into the new language, while balancing
              tradeoffs in design while keeping the core functionality as
              similar as possible.

              accomplish industry-specific goals.
            </li>
            <p>
              React and TypeScript are very popular programming tools for
              developing web applications, while WPF with C# is very popular for
              creating desktop applications. My ability to first create the web
              application in React and then clone it into a desktop application
              in WPF showcases my grasp on many of the modern tools and
              computing solutions that are desired by employers. Cloning
              products like this is also an example of an industry-specific goal
              that could very well be asked of me at a professional setting.
            </p>
            <li>
              I designed, developed, and delivered professional-quality oral,
              written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically
              sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and
              contexts.
            </li>
            <p>
              I developed this enhancement in a way where anyone could delve
              into the code and understand how it is built and how it works.
              This was done by effective inline and header comments, as well as
              descriptive variable and file names. My ability to communicate my
              design choices and project structure through the code itself is
              evident in this project.

          Enhancing the artifact taught me how to adapt an application to a new
          framework (from React to WPF) while maintaining its core
          functionality. I learned how to manage user input more efficiently,
          optimize application performance, and create a better experience with
          enhanced UI design. A major challenge I faced was the transition from
          a web-based design approach to a desktop-based environment. I had to
          rethink how navigation and state management work in WPF compared to
          React. Additionally, dealing with data display in WPF required careful
          attention to styling and alignment to maintain clarity and usability.
          It also took some time to learn the different ways to style the
          application, as WPF has different styling rules than CSS. Overcoming
          these challenges strengthened my problem-solving abilities and
          deepened my understanding of desktop application development.

        <h3 class="heading">Enhancement 2: Algorithms and Data Structures</h3>
        <p class="main-text">
          The enhancement I selected for this category is a Doubly Linked List
          (DLL) that uses an Insertion Sort algorithm. Initially, the project
          used an array-based structure for managing shifts, but I replaced it
          with a DLL and incorporated the Insertion Sort algorithm for dynamic
          sorting based on criteria such as date, hours worked, tips, and total
          earnings. This transition showcases my ability to apply complex data
          structures and algorithms to solve real-world problems efficiently.
        </p>
        <p class="main-text">
          The main motivation for using a Doubly Linked List over an array was
          to improve insertion and deletion performance. Arrays have a time
          complexity of O(n) for inserting or removing elements, which becomes
          inefficient when dealing with frequent modifications. A DLL, however,
          allows for O(1) insertion and deletion by manipulating pointers,
          making it well-suited for dynamically managing shifts. This change
          also demonstrates my understanding of memory management, as a DLL
          requires careful handling of 'prev' and 'next' pointers.
        </p>
        <p class="main-text">
          To further enhance the flexibility of the ViewShifts page, I
          implemented an Insertion Sort algorithm tailored to work with the DLL.
          While this algorithm has a time complexity of O(nÂ²), it is efficient
          for the smaller datasets typical in the Wage Tracker. The trade-off
          was justified because sorting is done less frequently than inserting
          shifts. The process of adapting the Insertion Sort to a DLL, which
          requires sequential traversal of nodes instead of direct indexing like
          arrays, challenged me to improve my understanding of node traversal
          and pointer manipulation.

            </li>
            <p>
              By replacing an array-based system with a more efficient doubly
              linked list, I improved both the flexibility and performance of my
              Wage Tracker application. This design choice allowed me to manage
              the trade-offs between ease of implementation and performance,
              which are key considerations when working with complex data
              structures and algorithms.

            </li>
            <p>
              By implementing the DLL with the Insertion Sort, I displayed my
              ability to make a design choice based on the expected use of the
              application, and pick a data structure and algorithm to implement
              sorting and improve insertion, without changing the core
              functionality of how data is stored and used in the application.

        <p class="main-text">
          Implementing the DLL and Insertion Sort involved several challenges,
          particularly with sorting linked nodes. Unlike arrays, linked lists
          require traversal from the head node to find the correct insertion
          point, making pointer manipulation and memory management crucial. I
          also had to account for edge cases like inserting nodes at the
          beginning or end of the list, which required careful consideration of
          list integrity. The enhancements I made to the Wage Tracker project
          demonstrate my ability to integrate advanced data structures and
          algorithms into a real-world application. By improving the performance
          and functionality of the ViewShifts page, this artifact highlights my
          skills in algorithms and data structures, and shows that I understand
          the trade-offs between them.

        <h3 class="heading">Enhancement 3: Databases</h3>
        <p class="main-text">
          For this enhancement, I created a server-side Express.js application
          that connects to a MongoDB database to manage shift data for the
          wage-tracking system. The project provides full CRUD (Create, Read,
          Update, Delete) functionality for storing and retrieving shift
          records, including details such as shift type, hours worked, and tips
          received.
        </p>
        <p class="main-text">
          I selected this enhancement because it demonstrates my proficiency in
          working with databases, a crucial skill in software development. The
          project highlights my ability to implement back-end solutions using
          modern frameworks such as Express.js and MongoDB. It also showcases my
          understanding of how to design RESTful APIs to interact with a
          database, validating user input, and ensuring data integrity
          throughout the application. By enhancing this artifact, I was able to
          incorporate industry best practices, such as implementing schema
          validation using Zod for robust error handling and improving the
          overall security of the application by adding data validation checks.
        </p>
        <p class="main-text">
          This artifact is an important representation of my database skills
          because it involves not just storing data but also designing a backend
          server with a REST API that allows for flexible manipulation of that
          data. This has practical applications in many areas of software
          development, such as building scalable web applications, which are
          core components of modern software engineering. It also showcases my
          skills on error handling, input validation, and the use of environment
          variables, which all show a good foundation of security focused
          programming.

              This artifact demonstrates my ability to work with databases and
              APIs, which are essential for creating collaborative environments.
              By structuring the backend in a modular, scalable manner,
              I&#8217;ve ensured that future developers or collaborators will be
              able to integrate, modify, and extend the system easily. The clear
              and well-documented routes for API calls enable diverse teams to

              industry-standard tools to build efficient solutions. The
              enhancements made to this artifact demonstrate my ability to
              combine these tools effectively to create a robust, full-stack
              application, from the back-end to the database layer. These skills

            <p>
              While working on this enhancement, I focused on security
              improvements by adding schema validation and ensuring that user
              input is strictly controlled before being sent to the database. By
              using the validation library Zod, I made sure that invalid or
              malicious data could not enter the database, reducing the risk of
              attacks such as injection vulnerabilities. This demonstrates my
              ability to anticipate security flaws and develop solutions to
              mitigate them.

          Through this enhancement process, I learned a lot about the importance
          of validation and security when working with databases. Initially, the
          artifact lacked any form of input validation, which posed a risk for
          data corruption or potential security vulnerabilities. By
          incorporating validation mechanisms with Zod, I not only enhanced the
          security of the system but also improved its robustness by ensuring
          that only valid data could be entered into the database. One of the
          biggest challenges was learning how to handle complex validation
          errors and returning them in a user-friendly format. This experience
          taught me how crucial proper error handling is for user experience and
          security.
        </p>
        <p class="main-text">
          Additionally, I reinforced my understanding of database interaction
          with MongoDB, particularly how to design efficient queries for
          retrieving, updating, and deleting data. This practical experience in
          manipulating database records in a secure, reliable manner was
          invaluable for solidifying my skills in backend development.
