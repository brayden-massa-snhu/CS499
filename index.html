          Throughout my journey in the Computer Science program, I have
          developed a diverse skill set that spans software engineering, data
          structures, algorithms, database management, full stack development,
          cyber security, and UI/UX design. I have also studied common project
          organization techniques such as Waterfall and Agile.
        </p>
        <p>
          More importantly than the Computer Science skills I have learned, this
          program has taught me how to understand and learn new topics easily.
          The further along I got through the program, the faster I was able to
          understand new concepts, frameworks, and even programming languages.
          My ability to learn how to solve different problems has flourished
          with my time in the Computer Science program. This can be seen as
          marginally more significant than the specific skills I have learned,
          as the ability to learn new things efficiently is one of the most
        </p>
        <p>
          To support my understanding of these concepts, I have enhanced a
          project that I built for food service workers to track their tips. I
          call the application "Wage Tracker". These enhancements not only
          highlight my experience in the skills listed above, but also showcase
          my ability to communicate with both technical and non-technical
          audiences.
